# Password-Strength-Checker Desktop Application
This is my second project, which I developed during my cybersecurity training provided by the Azerbaijan Cybersecurity Center and Technion. The PasswordChecker is a simple yet powerful desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to assess the strength of their passwords and provides recommendations on how to enhance them for better security.

**Features:**

Password Strength Assessment: The application evaluates passwords based on various factors such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and common words.
Interactive Interface: Users can input their passwords and instantly receive feedback on their strength along with recommendations to improve them.
Informative Info Page: The app includes an information page providing a synopsis and description of its functionality for users' reference.
User-Friendly Navigation: Simple navigation buttons enable users to move between the main page, password checking page, and information page effortlessly.
Quit Confirmation: Before exiting the application, users are prompted with a confirmation dialog to ensure they intend to quit.
**Usage:**

Launch the application.
Navigate through the main page, password checking page, and information page using the provided buttons.
Enter a password on the password checking page and click the "Check" button to assess its strength.
Receive instant feedback on the password's strength and recommendations for improvement.
Optionally, explore the information page for a synopsis and description of the application.

**Note:** This application was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate password strength assessment techniques and enhance user awareness of password security best practices.
